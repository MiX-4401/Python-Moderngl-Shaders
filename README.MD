Starting on the 13/11/23, I have writing a single shader program with OpenGL for Manulelly's silly cat-in-a-sink game  
The name of file represents the date of when I started making the shader, the window caption represents the date of release

Edit:
This is repo is a shader dunmp for shaders I design along my journy in Graphics Programming.
_lib.py files contain classes for 'quick-shader building' and _BoilerPlate files let easy copy/paste for new shader enviroments.
Constantly expanding the library, new additions include:
 : shader passes
 -> Allows for complex shader passes to be rendered in any ShaderProgram
 -> Including: Bloom and Blur
