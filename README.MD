This is repo is a shader dunmp for shaders I design along my journy in Graphics Programming.
_lib.py files contain classes for 'quick-shader building' and _BoilerPlate files let easy copy/paste for new shader enviroments.
Constantly expanding the library, new additions include:
 : shader passes
 -> Easy shader enviroments
 -> Allows for complex shader passes to be rendered in any ShaderProgram
